Note: I am currently trying to get in touch with Frontier Developments in order to get the allowance for continuing the development of this not game advantage taking tool. Maybe I will be allowed to make it fully or with some limitation. No matter which way this goes, I will find a solution for this quality of life tool.

More info will be added soon!
